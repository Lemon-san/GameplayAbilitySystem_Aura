**[In-Progress]**

Stephen Ulibarri full game development project focused on using the Gameplay Ability System centered on RPG Mechanics, Gameplay Abilities, GAS multiplayer elements and Unreal Engine Systems.

Work that was done for this project was imported from my azure dev ops repository (Feb.8): [UnrealMango](https://dev.azure.com/UnrealMango/_git/GameplayAbilitySystem_Aura). Every future development/commit from that point forward will be found in this github.
